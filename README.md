**Instructions:**

1. **Table Creation:**
    - Create an HTML table with at least 3 columns and 4 rows.
    - Utilize appropriate table elements such as **`<table>`**, **`<tr>`** (table row), **`<th>`** (table header), and **`<td>`** (table data) to structure your table.
    - Populate the table with meaningful data. For instance, you can create a table displaying information about different fruits, with columns representing Name, Color, and Taste.
2. **Unordered List (ul):**
    - Below the table, create an unordered list (ul) with at least 5 list items (li).
    - Each list item should contain a brief description or item of your choice. For example, you can list your favorite movies, books, or places to visit.
3. **Ordered List (ol):**
    - Following the unordered list, create an ordered list (ol) with at least 3 list items.
    - Use the ordered list to represent a step-by-step process or a ranking of items. This could be a list of steps for preparing a recipe or your top priorities for the week.
4. **Form Creation with Enhanced Validation:**
    - Design a simple HTML form that includes:
        - Text input for the user's name with a **`minlength`** of 3 and a **`maxlength`** of 50 characters.
        - Email input which is required and with placeholder.
        - Radio buttons for gender selection (Male/Female/Other).
        - A drop-down menu (select element) for age range (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.).
        - A checkbox for opting into a newsletter.
        - A submit button to submit the form.
5. **Validation:**
    - Implement basic form validation. Ensure that the name field meets the specified **`minlength`** and **`maxlength`** criteria. Additionally, validate that at least one gender option is selected. You can achieve this using the **`required`**, **`minlength`**, **`maxlength`**, and other relevant attributes.

**Submission Guidelines:**

This assignment is intended for practice purposes only, and there is no requirement for submission. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of HTML elements, particularly tables, lists, and forms, with an emphasis on enhanced validation techniques.
